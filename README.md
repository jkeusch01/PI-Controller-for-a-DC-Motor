# PI-Controller-for-a-DC-Motor
The goal of the project is to build a controller for a DC motor. The DC motor is then used to functionalize an escalator. 
The controller used was determined based on parameters received when starting the project. 
A PI (Proportional-Integral) controller was used and implemented onto a block diagram of an electromechanical system.
